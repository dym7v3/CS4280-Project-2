The scanner implementation is option : 3.

I made a excel document that contains my table. It is stored in the same directory as the main.cpp(Project1 directory) file.
It is called: "Compiler Graph".

The driver is a function named "Token * Driver(const string &);" which is called by the Test_Scanner function.
The driver function is located in the scanner.cpp file.
The routine will allow you to have tokens not separated by whitespace. So if you do something like loop() and it will return 3 tokens.
It also keeps track of the line numbers.

I have the same table as in excel file built out as a 2-D array called "table" located in the scanner.cpp file.
The excel document is color coded to give an easier understanding of how it works.
It is basically the same as the example in class.
